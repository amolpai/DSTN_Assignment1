    Input of function - Logical address, currently executing process, pid of that process, file descriptor of that process
                        Request type of the instruction - can be DATA_REQUEST or INSTRUCTION_REQUEST, kernel structure
    Purpose of the function - It executes the instruction requested by the process. The instruction has a logical address given by 'address'.
                              This function performs all the operations necessary for the execution of the process.
                              The flow chart of executing the instruction is as follows -
                              Search in TLB. If it is a TLB miss, search the page no in the main memory and update the tlb.
                              If it is a TLB hit, search L1 and L2 cache for the data. If both caches are misses, we search the main memory for the data.
                              The L1 cache is split into two parts - L1_data and L1_instruction. 
                              check_cpu_write function is used to check whether cpu wants to write data in l1 cache. We have used a random number generator which will generate 75%read requests and 75% write requests.
    Output/Result of the function - It returns a value 1 if the instruction was completed successfully. Else, it returns 0 indicating it was a page fault and we need to context switch to a different process.
